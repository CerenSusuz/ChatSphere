ðŸš€ Just wrapped up a milestone on my real-time chat app: ChatSphere! ðŸ§©
Over the past weeks, Iâ€™ve been building ChatSphere, a full-stack real-time messaging platform with modern architecture and scalable components. Hereâ€™s a quick peek into the technologies and structure behind the project:
ðŸ”§ Tech Stack & Architecture:
Blazor WebAssembly for the frontend â€“ dynamic and responsive UI.
ASP.NET Core Web API as the backend â€“ clean, modular services.
SignalR for real-time, bi-directional communication (think live chat ðŸ’¬).
Entity Framework Core for database operations.
JWT Authentication to ensure secure user access.
MediatR + CQRS for clean separation of commands and queries.
Structured following Clean Architecture principles:
 âž¤ Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Backend, and Client layers.
ðŸ§± The goal was to create a system thatâ€™s scalable, testable, and easy to maintain. Every feature â€“ from room management to live messaging â€“ is built with modularity and clarity in mind.
